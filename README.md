# mouseovercolor
mouseovercolor is a tool that shows the color under the mouse pointer. It can show different representations of the color. 

## Requirements
mouseovercolor requires [jruby](https://www.jruby.org/).

## Use
After starting mouseovercolor, move your mouse pointer over the color that you want to find out. You can press 1-7 to select different representations of the color (1: rgb, 2: hex, 3: hsl, 4: hwb, 5: cmyk, 6: NCol, 7:hsv). 

Pressing `Escape` key or clicking with the mouse exits the program after copying the current representation shown on the screen. 

You can press `Space` key to switch between showing the representation text in HTML format and showing a simple comma-separated list.
